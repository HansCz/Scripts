Execution:
========
* Boot a live CD (and execute the following:)
* pacman -Syu
* pacman -S python2
* wget [install.py](install.py)
* wget [inside_install.py](inside_install.py)
* python2 install.py

I'm working on creating a bashscript for all of the above which would require less interaction.
That or merge it into a live-iso but it will require the same job.
